# Welcome to Abigail's Learning journal!

Hello! My name is *Abigail Benjamin*. I am a software engineer. 
I am orginally from Grenada. I reside in Grand Cayman with my husband and our children. I am a teacher by day and full time mom. 
*I love to learn and see other learn.

My favorite places are the beach and waterfalls and I love ice-cream.

### Learning Journal

The purpose of this site is to journal and practice all the things that I am learning as I move through Code Fellows curriculum.
I want to keep track of my learning and see my progression. Also, to build a good cheat sheet for me as I learn more about sofware development.

### Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is believing you can do it! Being dedicated and hardworking towards the cause!
*I believe, therefore I will -- regardless of.*

Words I live by:

```markdown
God has given me everything I need to success, I just need to apply myself!
 2 Peter 1:3
